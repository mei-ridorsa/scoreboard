# Real-time scoreboard

This is an ongoing small project used to put into practice some theoretical concepts that may arise along the way. The idea is to keep improving this project with good practices (it's far from the goal right now!).

## The ranking
The main concept is that we have several users, each one with a numeric score. We want to be able to add to this score and to set absolute scores as well.

Given that, we want to be able to query the ranking, getting the n top scores and also the score at a given position (and the n positions around it)

## A partial list that things that need to be done
* Implement database persistence.
* Add API endpoints.
* More tests are needed.
